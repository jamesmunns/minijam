# Minijam

This is a tiny, first attempt at a sequencer for Mnemos.

Eventually it should be something bigger (or a part of something bigger), but the goals here are roughly:

* Come up with a way to sequence a single track, with start/end timings, notes, picking different wave types
* Come up with some way to command (RPC? script?) that track
* Spread it out to 4-8 tracks simultaneously
* Come up with a user interface for all that
